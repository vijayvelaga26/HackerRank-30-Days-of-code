                                              Day-4 Topic Class vs Instance 

Task: 

Write a Person class with an instance variable,'age' , and a constructor that takes an integer,'initialAge' ,
as a parameter. The constructor must assign 'initialAge'  to 'age'  after confirming the argument passed as  is not negative;
if a negative argument is passed as 'initialAge', the constructor should set 'age'  to '0'  and print Age is not valid, setting age to 0.. 
In addition, you must write the following instance methods:

yearPasses() should increase the 'age ' instance variable by .
amIOld() should perform the following conditional actions:
If age< 13 , print You are young..
If age>=13 and age<18 , print You are a teenager..
Otherwise, print You are old..

Sol)
       class Person {
    public int age;     
	public Person(int initialAge) {
         // Add some more code to run some checks on initialAge
        if(initialAge<0){
            this.age=0;
            Console.WriteLine("Age is not valid, setting age to 0.");
        } else{
            this.age= initialAge;
        }
       
     }
     public void amIOld() {
        // Do some computations in here and print out the correct statement to the console 
         if(age<13){
            Console.WriteLine("You are young."); 
         }
         else if(age>=13 && age<18){
           Console.WriteLine("You are a teenager.");
         } else {
             Console.WriteLine("You are old.");
         }
     }

     public void yearPasses() {
        // Increment the age of the person in here
         this.age = age+1;;
     }
