Given the meal price (base cost of a meal), tip percent (the percentage of the meal price being added as tip), 
and tax percent (the percentage of the meal price being added as tax) for a meal,find and print the meal's total cost.

Input Format:
There are  lines of numeric input: 
The first line has a double, 'mealCost' (the cost of the meal before tax and tip). 
The second line has an integer,'tipPercert'  (the percentage of  being added as tip). 
The third line has an integer,'taxPercent'  (the percentage of  being added as tax).

Output Format:

Print The total meal cost is 'totalCost' dollars., where 'totalCost' is the rounded integer result of the entire bill
 ('mealCost' with added tax and tip).

Code:

using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System.IO;
class Solution {
    static void Main(String[] args) {
        /* Enter your code here. Read input from STDIN. Print output to STDOUT. Your class should be named Solution */
      //  Console.WriteLine("Please enter the cost of the meal");
        double mealCost= Convert.ToDouble(Console.ReadLine());
       // Console.WriteLine("Enter tip percent");
        int tipPercent= Convert.ToInt32(Console.ReadLine());
       // Console.WriteLine("Enter tax percent");
        int taxPercent= Convert.ToInt32(Console.ReadLine());       
        
        double totalMealCost = Math.Round((mealCost+ (mealCost*tipPercent/100) + (mealCost*taxPercent/100)));
          
         Console.WriteLine("The total meal cost is {0} dollars.", totalMealCost);
